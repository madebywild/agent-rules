  Meta-rule that instructs every LLM-powered agent how to write, store,
  and compile new “source-of-truth” rules.  
  - All new rules **must** live in `./agent-rules/` as Markdown files  
    with the same front-matter structure shown here.  
  - After a rule is added or changed, the agent must run
    `./translate_rules.ts` to regenerate provider-specific rule files
    automatically.  
  - Agents must **never** write or edit provider-specific rule files
    directly (e.g. “Cursor” rules); they are generated exclusively by
    the translation script.

# Meta-Rule: Authoring & Storing Agent Rules

## 1 · Where to Place New Rules

- Create every new rule as a **Markdown file** inside **`./agent-rules/`**.
- Name the file in **kebab-case**, summarising its intent  
  (e.g. `rate-limit-handling.md`).

## 2 · Mandatory Front-Matter

Each rule **must** begin with YAML front-matter exactly like this:

```yaml
---
description: |
  One-sentence summary of the rule’s purpose.
alwaysApply: false # or true, if the rule should always run
cursor:
  retrieval-strategy: always
---
```

### Optional Provider Filtering

You can control which providers process each rule by adding these optional fields:

```yaml
---
description: |
  One-sentence summary of the rule's purpose.
alwaysApply: false
# Only generate this rule for specific providers (comma-separated)
_includeOnlyForProviders: cursor,cline
# OR exclude this rule from specific providers (comma-separated)  
_excludeForProviders: claude
cursor:
  retrieval-strategy: always
---
```

**Provider filtering rules:**
- **`_includeOnlyForProviders`**: If specified, only the listed providers will process this rule
- **`_excludeForProviders`**: The listed providers will skip processing this rule
- If both are specified, `_includeOnlyForProviders` takes precedence
- These fields are automatically removed from generated output files
- Provider names should match the built-in provider IDs: `cursor`, `cline`, `claude`, `copilot`

## 3 · Compilation Workflow

After saving or modifying a rule inside this ./agent-rules folder:

```bash
npm run translate_rules
```

The script converts all Markdown rules in **`./agent-rules/`** into the
provider-specific formats expected by each agent type.

## 4 · Provider Files Are Read-Only

- **Do not** author, edit, or commit rule files that live inside provider
  folders (e.g. `./.cursor/rules/`, `./.clinerules/`).
- Treat those files as **generated artifacts**; regenerate them via the
  translation script whenever the source-of-truth rule changes.

## 5 · Good vs Bad Practice

### Good

```bash
# Create the source-of-truth rule
touch ./agent-rules/context-window.md
# (Add front-matter and content as described)
npm run translate_rules   # Regenerates provider files
```

### Bad

```bash
# Directly editing a Cursor-specific rule
vim ./cursor-rules/context-window.rule
# → Forbidden: this file will be overwritten by the translation script
```

Following this meta-rule keeps every provider in sync and preserves a
single, human-readable source of truth for all agent behaviour.
